					<p>
						Djabi Yaakoub, born on November 20, 1998 in Setif, Algeria. I obtained a baccalaureate degree in 2016 with a good grade to enter Farhat Abbas University in Setif.

					</p>
					<p>
						I studied at the university starting in 2017 until I obtained a bachelor’s degree in 2020. During these years, I started developing mobile applications using Android Studio and used the java + xml language to create applications. Also, my graduation memoir with a bachelor’s degree was a mobile application for calculating the amount of medication dosage for patients.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, I completed my studies to obtain a master’s degree in software engineering in 2022 with a good grade.
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing my studies, I learned to make applications with Flutter, where I made many applications as a freelancer, then I worked for Symloop, which specializes in making applications, then after that, GBS, which also specializes in this field, and for which I have been working since September 2023 until now, and during this period I created many applications. For the benefit of the companies I work for , I also work as a professor at the university at the same time.
