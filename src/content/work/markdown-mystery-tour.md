## E-Commerce

> Definition

Building an eCommerce app in Flutter involves several key steps. First, you set up your project and define models for products, users, and orders. Then, you create services to handle data fetching and interactions with the backend. The app's state is managed using a solution like Provider, which helps keep track of items in the shopping cart and user authentication. The user interface includes screens like product listings, product details, and a shopping cart, where users can browse, select, and purchase items. Finally, integrating a payment gateway allows secure transactions, and user profiles enable managing personal information and order history.
### Design

The design was taken from a free design on the Figma website and I turned it into an application that runs smoothly.

### Technology used

I linked the application to a ready-made API and used it as a backend for the application. I also used Firebase OTP to verify the phone number and Hive to store user data in addition to many other services , with Splash Screen , Boarding Screens... , i used Provider as State Management.

#### Some Packages

- Provider
- Hive
- Firebase OTP
